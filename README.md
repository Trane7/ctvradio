Whatupdoe!
B.E.S.T LLC (Being Empowered Starts Today) was established November of 2019 by Jason &quot;Biggie&quot;
Jackson, a son of Detroit, Michigan. Jason, being no stranger to the music industry, began his journey as an online
stereo broadcasting personality by founding B.E.S.T Podcast during the pandemic, a time when most not only lost
their jobs, but nearly lost hope. With special guest appearances by activists Sonya Reilly-Doswell and Ashley
Quiones catapulted B.E.S.T Podcast into what it is known for today as a positive, informative, and empowering
lifestyle motivator. A music enthusiast and full-time father, Jason resolved after being amongst those who lost their
job, that it was more advantageous to leap into podcasting, covering heavy-hitting content such as mental and
physical health, the daily struggles of the modern American, and optimism in the wake of global disaster. As
production gained steam, Mr. Jackson furthered the expansion of B.E.S.T LLC, resulting in the birth of Biggie &amp;
Ziggie Music Cafe (BZMC) which focused primarily on providing undergirding for unadvertised independent
musicians.
Biggie &amp; Ziggie Music Café (BZMC) continued to achieve its efforts to empower by interviewing
community leaders, entrepreneurs, motivational speakers and an array of influential figures. Jackson’s broadcasting
network has been associated with the likes of Boston MC’s Red Shadez and C4 The Bad Wolf, and Minnesota&#39;s own
Savitty, DJ Sota, and DJ Phoenix. After an upturn in popularity, the podcast launched its newest radio show: Rad,
Bad, Stay-At-Home Dad&#39;s in addition to rebranding BZMC into CTV (CatchThisVibe) Radio.
CTV(CatchThisVibe) Radio is now an indie artist/fan dream becoming the most sought out internet radio
station on TikTok and Twitch, covering the newest emerging artists, live streaming, and conducting unscheduled
organic interviews. The axis of CTV is to be an appendage and added platform for musicians, and to forge a special
connection with all who tune in to the broadcast. In 2021, BZMC and CTV RADIO merged in an effort to solidify
the platform for underground artists and encourage forward progress within the company. With this power move
made by Mr. Jackson, the success of B.E.S.T LLC skyrocketed. Jason saw a significant rise in numbers on social
media platforms like TikTok, forging a lane for creators to become more influential while encouraging other content
creators to engage with audiences in more captivating ways.
Rad, Bad, Stay At Home Dads provides listeners with entertaining and uplifting content hosted by two
homemaking fathers, both partaking in the journey and adventure of parenting on the other side of the modern
gender role scope. With Westernized gender functions switched for a father who has been the in-house provider for
eight years and a father who has provided in-home care to his children for two years, subscribers get to witness the
personal journeys and the contrast between housekeeping and fatherhood while gaining parenting tips for other rad,
bad, dads.
B.E.S.T LLC hopes to change lives by sharing funny moments, sad and vulnerable moments, new music
moments, and everything in-between! Come #CatchThisVibe as we #ShakeUpDaWorld being our #Best because
